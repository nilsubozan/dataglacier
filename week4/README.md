# Deployment On Flask
Machine learning model is deployed using Flask For this week. In this project, we've created a machine learning model that can predict a customer's annual income category by analyzing various demographic and behavioral attributes. We chose the Logistic Regression algorithm to build our predictive model, as it is a widely used method for tackling classification problems. We used a dataset that contains information about customers, including their age, gender, profession, spending score, work experience, and family size.

After we were done with the implementation of our model, we started to deploy our model on Flask.
Our web application designed to predict a customer's annual income category based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. By inputting relevant customer data such as age, gender, profession, spending score, work experience, and family size, users can quickly receive predictions about the customer's annual income category. These categories include 'Very Low', 'Low', 'Moderate', 'High', and 'Very High'.
